        <p>Here are the lyrics to "Shape of You" by Ed Sheeran: <br>
        **Verse 1** <br>
        The club isn't the best place to find a lover <br>
        So the bar is where I go <br>
        Me and my friends at the table doing shots <br>
        Drinking fast and then we talk slow <br>
        Come over and start up a conversation with just me <br>
        And trust me I'll give it a chance now <br>
        Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox <br>
        And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like <br>
        **Pre-Chorus** <br>
        Girl, you know I want your love <br>
        Your love was handmade for somebody like me <br>
        Come on now, follow my lead <br>
        I may be crazy, don't mind me <br>
        Say, boy, let's not talk too much <br>
        Grab on my waist and put that body on me <br>
        Come on now, follow my lead <br>
        Come, come on now, follow my lead <br>
        **Chorus** <br>
        I'm in love with the shape of you <br>
        We push and pull like a magnet do <br>
        Although my heart is falling too <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        And last night you were in my room <br>
        And now my bedsheets smell like you <br>
        Every day discovering something brand new <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        Every day discovering something brand new <br>
        I'm in love with the shape of you <br>
        **Verse 2** <br>
        One week in we let the story begin <br>
        We're going out on our first date <br>
        You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat <br>
        Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate <br>
        We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour <br>
        And how your family is doing okay <br>
        Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat <br>
        Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like <br>
        **Pre-Chorus** <br>
        Girl, you know I want your love <br>
        Your love was handmade for somebody like me <br>
        Come on now, follow my lead <br>
        I may be crazy, don't mind me <br>
        Say, boy, let's not talk too much <br>
        Grab on my waist and put that body on me <br>
        Come on now, follow my lead <br>
        Come, come on now, follow my lead <br>
        **Chorus** <br>
        I'm in love with the shape of you <br>
        We push and pull like a magnet do <br>
        Although my heart is falling too <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        And last night you were in my room <br>
        And now my bedsheets smell like you <br>
        Every day discovering something brand new <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        Every day discovering something brand new <br>
        I'm in love with the shape of you <br>
        **Bridge** <br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on <br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on <br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on <br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on <br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on <br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on <br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on <br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on <br>
        **Chorus** <br>
        I'm in love with the shape of you <br>
        We push and pull like a magnet do <br>
        Although my heart is falling too <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        Last night you were in my room <br>
        And now my bedsheets smell like you <br>
        Every day discovering something brand new <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on <br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on <br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on <br>
        Come on, be my baby, come on <br>
        I'm in love with your body <br>
        Every day discovering something brand new <br>
        I'm in love with the shape of you </p>
