[Intro]<br>
Psst, I see dead people<br>
(Mustard on the beat, ho)<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho<br>
Deebo, any rap nigga, he a free throw<br>
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, "Breathe, bro"<br>
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo<br>
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?<br>
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama<br>
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options<br>
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton<br>
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'<br>
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas<br>
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em<br>
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him<br>
Pole on him, extort shit, bully, Death Row<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us<br>
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?<br>
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last, nigga<br>
Put the whole coast on, that's a fact, nigga<br>
Put your whole city in a body bag, nigga<br>
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophile<br>
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up<br>
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff<br>
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?<br>
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-Minor<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us<br>
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Ayy, one, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy<br>
Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy<br>
Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy<br>
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy<br>
City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
Mm, mm-mm<br>
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)<br>
He a fan, he a fan, he a freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God<br>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life<br>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life<br>
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God<br>
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God<br>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life<br>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life<br>
Let me hear you say, "OV-ho" (OV-ho)<br>
Say, "OV-ho" (OV-ho)<br>
Then step this way, step that way<br>
Then step this way, step that way<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]<br>
Once upon a time, all of us was in chains<br>
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves<br>
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains<br>
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game<br>
The settlers was usin' town folk to make 'em richer<br>
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda<br>
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance<br>
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge<br>
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)<br>
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)<br>
21 gave you false street cred<br>
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)<br>
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)<br>
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied<br>
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars<br>
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
Mm, mm-mm<br>
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)<br>
He a fan, he a fan, he a freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God<br>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life<br>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life<br>
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God<br>
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God<br>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life<br>
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life<br>
Let me hear you say, "OV-ho" (OV-ho)<br>
Say, "OV-ho" (OV-ho)<br>
Then step this way, step that way<br>
Then step this way, step that way<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Are you my friend? Are we locked in?<br>
Then step this way, step that way<br>
Then step this way, step that way<br>
