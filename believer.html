        <strong>First Verse</strong><br>
        First things first<br>
        I'ma say all the words inside my head<br>
        I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh<br>
        The way that things have been, oh-ooh<br>
        <br>
        Second things second<br>
        Don't you tell me what you think that I could be<br>
        I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh<br>
        The master of my sea, oh-ooh<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Pre-Chorus</strong><br>
        I was broken from a young age<br>
        Taking my sulking to the masses<br>
        Writing my poems for the few<br>
        That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me<br>
        Singing from heartache, from the pain<br>
        Taking my message from the veins<br>
        Speaking my lesson from the brain<br>
        Seeing the beauty through the...<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Chorus</strong><br>
        Pain!<br>
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
        Pain!<br>
        You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br>
        Pain!<br>
        Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain<br>
        My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br>
        Pain!<br>
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Second Verse</strong><br>
        Third things third<br>
        Send a prayer to the ones up above<br>
        All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh<br>
        Your spirit up above, oh-ooh<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Pre-Chorus</strong><br>
        I was choking in the crowd<br>
        Building my rain up in the cloud<br>
        Falling like ashes to the ground<br>
        Hoping my feelings, they would drown<br>
        But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br>
        Inhibited, limited, till it broke open and rained down<br>
        It rained down, like...<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Chorus</strong><br>
        Pain!<br>
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
        Pain!<br>
        You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br>
        Pain!<br>
        Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain<br>
        My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br>
        Pain!<br>
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Bridge</strong><br>
        Last things last<br>
        By the grace of the fire and the flames<br>
        You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh<br>
        The blood in my veins, oh-ooh<br>
        But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br>
        Inhibited, limited, till it broke open and rained down<br>
        It rained down, like...<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Chorus</strong><br>
        Pain!<br>
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
        Pain!<br>
        You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br>
        Pain!<br>
        Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain<br>
        My life, my love, my drive, it came from...<br>
        Pain!<br>
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
